! 1. FORTRAN (now Fortran) was the first High Level programming language,
!    developed in 1954 by John Backus for IBM.
! 2. This language was commercially released in 1957.
! 3. FORTRAN stands for FORmula TRANslation. FORTRAN was developed for
!    engineering/scientific applications.
! 4. FORTRAN is extensively used in areas like Numerical Weather Forecasting,
!    Finite Element Analysis, Computational Fluid dynamics, Computational 
!    Physics etc.

! Historical development in FORTRAN may be summarized as follows-
! FORTRAN I - First version of FORTRAN Language developed in 1954. This version has 32
! statements.
! FORTRAN-II - First appeared in 1958. Introduced user defined subprograms.
! FORTRAN-III - Developed in 1958, but never released.
! FORTRAN-IV - Released in 1962, this version introduced LOGICAL data type, Boolean 
! expressions, LOGICAL IF etc.
! FORTRAN 66 - This was ANSI Standard version of FORTRAN IV
! FORTRAN 77 - Revised version of FORTRAN 66, released as FORTRAN 77 by ANSI. Provided
! support for Structured programming.
! FORTRAN 90 - Successor for FORTRAN 77, first released as an ISO standard in 1991 and 
! as an ANSI standard in 1992.
! FORTRAN 95 - This version was a minor revision of FORTRAN 90.
! FORTRAN 2003 - This is a major revision that introduced many new features like Derived
! Types, Object Oriented programming, Interoperability with C programming language.
! FORTRAN 2008 - This is minor version of FORTRAN 2003, which appeared in 2010.

! Computer Program: A computer program is a set of instructions for computer, arranged 
! in logical order, using a programming language, for doing something useful.

! Programming language: This is code for writing instructions Programming Language
! specifies rules of grammar (syntax) for writing instructions.

! Programming languages are classified as follows:
! 1. High Level Language (HLL)
! 2. Low Level Language (LLL)

! Translation Software:
! 1. Compilers - C/C++
! 2. Interpreters - Python
! 3. Assemblers

! Compilation - The process of translation of a program from High Level Language
! to Machine Language is called as Compilation

! Types of Statements: A program is a set of instructions (statements).
! Program has instructions for the Computer as well as for Translation Software
! (Compiler). Depending on whether the instructions are for Computer or for Compiler,
! (FORTRAN) statements are categorised as
! 1. Executable Statements
! 2. Non executable Statements

! Executable Statements: There are instructions for Computer, used during program 
! execution, for performing specific tasks. Some of the Executable Statements are 
! READ, WRITE, STOP, GOTO, IF, etc.

! Non-Executable Statements: These are instructions for Compiler, used during
! Compilation process. Some of the Non-Executable Statements are END, REAL,
! CHARACTER, DIMENSION, FORMAT etc.

! Fortran is case insensitive language unlike other modern languages like C, C++, Python
! Conventionally FORTRAN programs are written using uppercase letters
! A Fortran program consists of one Main Program and zero or more subprograms.
! The Main Program and the Subprograms are referred to as Program Modules or Program
! Units. The program execution always begins with the Main Program.
! The main program begins with Program Header (optional).
! The END statement is written as the last statement of Main Program and Program Units,
! if any.
